Such movement of a radiation source can be defined by so-called dwell times at hundreds of potential dwell positions, which must be configured to satisfy a clinical protocol of multiple different treatment criteria within a strictly-limited time frame of not more than one hour. In this article, we propose a bi-objective optimization model that intuitively encapsulates in two objectives the complicated high-dimensional multi-criteria nature of the BT treatment planning problem.

The main advantage of this strategy is that the practitioner just decides the desirable target size for the elitist archive while all the maintenance details are automatically handled.

Experimental results on a benchmark network show that if we may assume that the optimal network will be very similar to the starting network, restricted initialization is generally useful for solving DNEP and moreover it becomes more beneficial to use the simple GA.

In this paper, we present a novel evaluation relaxation method which is based on the conditional entropy measurement. The concept of conditional entropy is rigorously analyzed and then is used to investigate the stability of the population. Especially, we utilize the evaluation relaxation strategy (ERS) proposed herein to determine whether a candidate solution should be evaluated by actual functions or be estimated by surrogate models. BOA coupled with our entropy-based ERS, termed en-BOA, shows its superiority in significantly reducing the total number of expensive fitness evaluations until reliable convergence. Experimental results prove that the entropy-based ERS enhances the efficiency of BOA while not negatively affecting the scalability of the original algorithm. In addition, the effects of our efficiency enhancement technique on population sizing requirements are also discussed."

Recently, Empirical Linkage Learning (ELL) techniques were proposed for binary-encoded problems. While these techniques are computationally expensive, they have the benefit of never reporting spurious dependencies (false linkages), ie, marking two independent variables as being dependent. However, previous research shows that despite this property, for some problems, it is more suitable to employ more commonly-used Statistical-based Linkage Learning (SLL) techniques.

It is therefore essential to maintain a reliable supply of electricity to ensure the operation of such activities. The electricity supply, in a large part, depends on the underlying electrical networks that transfer electricity from power plants to meet the demand of end users. In the past, electricity consumption has grown over time and, at some point, the electricity demand will exceed the current capacity of certain network assets, causing overloads on parts of the networks. Functioning under overload conditions reduces the reliability of the networks and also damages network assets. Network reinforcement is thus required. This incurs substantial investment costs and time-consuming activities, such as acquisitions of new assets, constructions of substations, and installations of suitable cables and other electrical devices. Network operator companies, therefore, need to properly predict the growth of electricity demand and make suitable expansion plans to enhance the capacity of their networks. In addition, the recent emergence of renewable energy sources and smart grid technologies changes electricity consumption behaviors of users, the growth of electricity demand in general, and also the directions of network flows (due to local generation). This poses additional challenges that need to be addressed by the network operators. In this dissertation, we are interested in medium-voltage distribution networks, which are electrical networks that deliver electricity from high-voltage transmission networks to …"
